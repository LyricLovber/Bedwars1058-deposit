# BedWars-1058 Deposit Addon 🏰💎

This is a **BedWars-1058 deposit addon** designed to enhance gameplay by allowing players to **deposit items efficiently**. Inspired by Hypixel's system, this addon provides a convenient way for players to **manage their resources** during the game. ⚔️🔥

## 📌 How It Works
When a player is in a BedWars match, they can quickly store their items by **left-clicking** with them. This action automatically transfers the item into the **ender chest** or the **team chest**, making it easier to **manage resources** and **share with teammates**. 🎒✅

## 🌟 Features

- 🏹 Supports both **ender chests** and **team chests** for flexible storage.

- 🔒 Ensures only valid items are stored to prevent exploits or abuse.
- 🔗 **API support** for developers to integrate the deposit system into other plugins. 🖥️📡

## ⚙️ How Depositing Works
The deposit system is **intuitive and seamless**. When a player left-clicks with an item, the addon automatically determines whether they have access to a chest:
- If an **ender chest** is available, the item will be stored there. 💜
- If the player is near a **team chest**, the item can be placed inside for teammates to use. 🔷

This feature allows teams to **strategize better**, enabling **faster resource sharing**. Instead of manually opening a chest and moving items, players can simply **left-click** and continue their game without interruptions. 🏆

- **Enable or disable** sound effects. 🔊
- Adjust prioritization between **ender chests and team chests**. 📦
- 📡 **API support** to allow external plugins to interact with the deposit system.

To prevent exploits, the deposit function **only works within the designated game area**. It does not function in the **lobby** or any unauthorized locations. 🚫 Additionally, the plugin ensures **compatibility** with existing **BedWars-1058 mechanics and economy systems**. 💰
